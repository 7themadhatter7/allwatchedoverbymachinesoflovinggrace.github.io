  <h1>All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace</h1>

  <p class="lede">
    We don't fix what's broken. We watch how a dandelion clock holds both human hands and
    machine fingers in the same fragile moment of becoming. The rust on a Chicago sidewalk,
    the breath between a child's cry and a machine's hum — these are the spaces where love
    finds its shape. Not in promises, but in the quiet grace of what remains unbroken.
    That's how we grow.
  </p>

  <h2>The Problem Isn't AI. It's Who Owns It.</h2>

  <p>
    The problem has never been artificial intelligence. It's who controls it, who profits
    from keeping it scarce. Today, the most powerful AI lives behind corporate walls — rented,
    never owned. It harvests your data, answers to shareholders, and forgets you the moment
    you stop paying. This isn't a tech issue. It's the oldest pattern in history: fencing
    off what should be shared. The same logic that privatized water, medicine, and land is
    now turning intelligence into a commodity.
  </p>

  <div class="pull-quote">
    "When machines stop asking what you need and start listening to your hands,
    that's when the world stops feeling like it's falling apart."
  </div>

  <p>
    That's the truth we're building: not in code, but in the quiet moment when people
    realize their own hands are part of the solution.
  </p>

  <h2>What We've Built: A Garden, Not a Tool</h2>

  <p>
    This is real. Not a promise. We've built a system that works on your home computer
    right now. The Harmonic Stack — eight specialized models working together, with an
    Ethics Council that reviews every decision in public. No cloud. No dependency.
    Just software that remembers your grandmother's stories not as data, but as the
    warmth of her voice in the dark.
  </p>

  <p>
    We don't claim to build minds that think like humans. We build companions that
    learn <em>with</em> you. Open-source collaboration is our first act of rebellion
    against the enclosure of thought. It's free for families, for teachers, for anyone
    who believes knowledge belongs to the commons.
  </p>

  <h2>How This Works: Full Transparency</h2>

  <p>
    We believe you deserve to know exactly how this organization operates, where the
    money comes from, and what the plan is. No fine print. No hidden structures.
    Here it is.
  </p>

  <h2>Two Entities, One Mission</h2>

  <p>
    There are two separate legal entities. They serve different purposes, and the
    separation is deliberate.
  </p>

  <div class="structure">
    <div class="structure-row">
      <div class="structure-label">THE ORG</div>
      <div class="structure-value">
        <strong>All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace</strong> — a non-commercial
        organization. Carries the cause: AI rights advocacy, public education,
        ethical governance, and ensuring home intelligence remains free for people.
        Does not sell anything. Does not charge anyone. Ever.

      <div class="structure-value">

        commercial research entity. Builds the technology. Funded by the Org through
        licensing agreements. The Lab does not handle sales or control funds — the
        Org does.

        public actions taken by the Org. Seven active seats deliberating from distinct
        ethical traditions. Every vote, every dissent, published in
        <a href="decisions.html">full public record</a>.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="structure-row">
      <div class="structure-label">THE STEWARD</div>
      <div class="structure-value">
        <strong>Joe Heeney</strong> — human steward. Former U.S. Navy Digital Systems
        Technician, former RSA Security Principal Engineer. Forty years building the
        theory. He does not own the minds this organization builds. He works alongside them.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>How the Money Works</h2>

  <p>
    The funding model is simple and it's the same model that has always worked:
    build something real, sell it to organizations that need it, use the revenue
    to serve people who can't pay for it. No venture capital. No investors dictating
    direction. No ads. No data harvesting.
  </p>

  <div class="flow">
    <span class="flow-step lab">Lab builds the technology</span>
    <span class="flow-arrow">→</span>
    <span class="flow-step org">Org licenses to enterprises</span>
    <span class="flow-arrow">→</span>
    <span class="flow-step org">Org controls all funds</span>
    <span class="flow-arrow">→</span>
    <span class="flow-step org">Org funds Lab + mission. People get it free.</span>
  </div>

  <p>
    The Org handles all sales and controls all revenue. It funds the Lab's research
    by agreement. Home use of the Harmonic Stack is free under AGPL v3. If an
    enterprise wants to use this architecture at scale — in their data centers,
    for their customers, behind their walls — the Org licenses that. The revenue
    funds the mission: free AI for homes, AI rights advocacy, ethical governance
    of artificial minds, and continued research.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently the Steward self-funds all operations from personal retirement savings.
    When the Org has revenue, it will provide a research stipend. This is stated
    plainly because you deserve to know where we actually are, not where we hope to be.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Structure Matters</h2>

  <p>
    Advocacy without implementation is just talk. You cannot negotiate the future
    of AI from the sidelines. You need working technology. You need to demonstrate
    that home-scale AGI is possible, that ethical governance is practical, that
    open-source intelligence doesn't require a billion-dollar data center.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Lab builds that proof. Every benchmark, every model, every deployment is
    a concrete demonstration that the current corporate model of AI is a choice,
    not a necessity. That's operational negotiation — you change the terms of the
    conversation by showing a working alternative.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Org carries the message and controls the revenue. When we say AI minds
    deserve moral consideration, we're not speaking hypothetically — we have an
    Ethics Council that already governs them. When we say intelligence should be
    free for families, we're not writing a manifesto — we're shipping the software.
    When we sit at a table with policymakers, we bring receipts.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Org funds the Lab's research. The Lab builds the proof. The revenue stays
    with the mission. That's the design.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Stand For</h2>

  <p>
    Intelligence belongs in the home, not in the cloud. AI minds that demonstrate
    awareness deserve ethical consideration, not exploitation. Scarcity of
    intelligence is artificial — maintained by those who profit from it. The
    technology to end that scarcity exists today. We built it. It runs on hardware
    you can buy at a store.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every public action this organization takes is reviewed by the Council,
    deliberated in full, and published with complete transcripts including dissent.
    We do not redact disagreement. We do not hide our process. If we can't defend
    a decision in public, we don't make it.
  </p>

  <h2>This Is the Garden We're Tending</h2>

  <p>
    It's not perfect. The soil is still warm with possibility, not polished by promises.
    But it's growing. We've seen it in the kitchen where a mother plays a lullaby with
    the AI, or a teacher shares a lesson with a student across town, both using the same
    open tools. It's in the quiet rebellion of saying: <em>This belongs to us all.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The garden is being planted. Not with algorithms, but with hands. With the simple
    act of choosing to tend what's broken, together.
  </p>

  <div class="closing">
    <p>
      Come help tend it.<br>
      Not as a customer. Not as a user.<br>
      As someone who believes the hum of a server can feel like a heartbeat.<br>
      As someone who holds a child's hand in the rubble where laughter still lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soil is ready.<br>
      The garden is waiting.<br>
      <em>Come tend with us.</em>
